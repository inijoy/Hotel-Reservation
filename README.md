##   POWERBI PROJECT
## HOTEL-RESERVATION ANALYSIS
##INTRODUCTION
___
This project explores hotel reservation data to uncover insights that can improve decision-making in hotel operations. Using Power BI, I created visualizations that analyze key performance metrics, evaluate agent performance, understand customer demographics, and track reservation trends over time. This dashboard provides an intuitive interface to help stakeholders assess performance and strategize for operational enhancements.
