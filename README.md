# Hotel-Reservation Analysis
##INTRODUCTION
___
This project explores hotel reservation data to uncover insights that can improve decision-making in hotel operations. Using Power BI, I created visualizations that analyze key performance metrics, evaluate agent performance, understand customer demographics, and track reservation trends over time. This dashboard provides an intuitive interface to help stakeholders assess performance and strategize for operational enhancements.

##POWER BI CONCEPTS APPLIED
•	Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used Power Query to filter and clean data, removing inconsistencies and preparing the data for analysis.
•	Data Modeling: Defined relationships across multiple tables to enable connected insights, particularly between reservation details, agent records, and customer demographics.
•	KPIs and DAX Calculations: Utilized DAX to create KPIs and calculated columns, enabling the analysis of dynamic metrics and trends.
•	Visualizations: Designed custom visuals to highlight performance metrics, agent efficiency, customer insights, and time-based trends, enabling quick, data-driven insights.
